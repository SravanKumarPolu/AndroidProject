Tired of feeling broke at the end of the month?

ImpulseVault helps you pause before you spend, think clearly, and save money from regret buys.

💡 How it works

• When you feel like buying something, log it in ImpulseVault.

• Start a short cool-down (5–60 minutes).

• Decide later: skip it or still buy.

• Track how much money you've protected from impulse spending.

🔥 Designed for youth

Perfect for Zomato/Swiggy, Amazon, Flipkart, gaming purchases, online courses and random "just because" buys.

📊 See your progress

• Total money saved from skipped buys

• Your most dangerous categories (food, shopping, gaming, etc.)

• Moods that trigger your worst spending (bored, stressed, FOMO)

🧠 Build better habits

Small pauses today → big savings tomorrow.

ImpulseVault is your pre-spend shield, not a boring expense tracker.
