### Patents
- **What they protect:** Inventions, processes, and functional designs
- **Relevance to app icons:** Generally not applicable (icons are usually protected by trademarks/copyrights)
- **Duration:** 20 years from filing
- **Risk level for icons:** Low (design patents are rare for simple icons)

### Trademarks

- **Relevance to app icons:** **HIGH** - This is the main concern
- **Duration:** Indefinite (as long as in use)
- **Risk level for icons:** **HIGH** - Many app icons are trademarked

### Copyrights
- **What they protect:** Original creative works (art, designs, code)
- **Relevance to app icons:** **MEDIUM** - Your icon design is automatically copyrighted
- **Duration:** Life of creator + 70 years (varies by country)
- **Risk level for icons:** Medium - Need to ensure your design is original

## Key Principles for Avoiding Issues

### 1. Originality is Essential

**DO:**
- Create designs from scratch
- Use your own unique geometric compositions
- Combine common shapes in novel ways
- Develop a distinctive style

**DON'T:**
- Copy or trace existing icons
- Modify existing trademarked designs
- Use "inspiration" that's too similar to existing icons
- Create derivatives of well-known logos

### 2. Avoid Well-Known Trademarks

**Icons/Logos to Avoid:**
- Apple's lock icon (system lock symbol)
- Android robot or Android logo
- Google logo or Google app icons
- Banking app icons (Chase, Bank of America, etc.)
- Shopping app icons (Amazon, eBay, etc.)
- Social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
- Payment app icons (PayPal, Venmo, etc.)

**Why:** These are heavily trademarked and protected. Even slight similarities can cause issues.

### 3. Conduct Trademark Searches

**Before Finalizing Your Icon:**

1. **USPTO Trademark Search:**
   - Visit: https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search
   - Search for similar designs in relevant categories
   - Categories to check: Class 9 (Software), Class 42 (Computer services)

2. **Google Play Store Search:**
   - Search for apps with similar icons
   - Check if any existing apps use similar designs
   - Note any potential conflicts

3. **App Store Search:**
   - Check iOS App Store for similar icons
   - Look for apps in the same category (finance, productivity)

4. **General Web Search:**
   - Google Image search for your icon concept
   - Check if similar designs exist elsewhere

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. "Inspired By" Designs
**Problem:** Creating a design "inspired by" a popular app icon
**Risk:** Even if not identical, similarity can cause trademark issues
**Solution:** Create completely original designs

### 2. Using Stock Icons
**Problem:** Using icons from icon libraries that may be trademarked
**Risk:** Stock icons may have licensing restrictions
**Solution:** Create custom icons or use properly licensed stock icons

### 3. Modifying Existing Icons
**Problem:** Taking an existing icon and "making it your own"
**Risk:** Derivative works can infringe on original copyrights/trademarks
**Solution:** Start from scratch with original concepts

### 4. Similar Color Schemes
**Problem:** Using the same color scheme as a well-known app
**Risk:** While colors alone aren't trademarked, combined with similar design, it can be problematic
**Solution:** Use unique color combinations (your indigo is fine)

### 5. Generic Designs
**Problem:** Using overly generic designs (shopping cart, wallet, etc.)
**Risk:** Many generic designs are already trademarked by specific companies
**Solution:** Create abstract, unique designs

**Cost:** ~$250-350 per class (USPTO)
